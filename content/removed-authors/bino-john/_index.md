We started collaboration with Bino and his team at AstraZeneca in 2020. We work on the development of (graph) machine learning algorithms for drug discovery and drug repurposing that can lead to real-world impact. See [his LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bino-john-597a0912/) for more information.
