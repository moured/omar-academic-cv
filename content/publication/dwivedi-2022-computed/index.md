abstract: 'Background: Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and lung disease may pose a diagnostic dilemma between idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and PH associated with lung disease (PH-CLD). The prognostic impact of common computed tomography (CT) parenchymal features is unknown.

Methods: 660 IPAH and PH-CLD patients assessed between 2001 and 2019 were included. Reports for all CT scans 1 year prior to diagnosis were analysed for common lung parenchymal patterns. Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis were performed.

Results: At univariate analysis of the whole cohort, centrilobular ground-glass (CGG) changes (hazard ratio, HR 0.29) and ground-glass opacification (HR 0.53) predicted improved survival, while honeycombing (HR 2.79), emphysema (HR 2.09) and fibrosis (HR 2.38) predicted worse survival (all p<0.001). Fibrosis was an independent predictor after adjusting for baseline demographics, PH severity and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (HR 1.37, p<0.05). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of IPAH who had an absence of reported parenchymal lung disease (IPAH-noLD) demonstrated superior survival to patients diagnosed with either IPAH who had coexistent CT lung disease or PH-CLD (2-year survival of 85%, 60% and 46%, respectively, p<0.05). CGG changes were present in 23.3% of IPAH-noLD and 5.8% of PH-CLD patients. There was no significant difference in survival between IPAH-noLD patients with or without CGG changes. PH-CLD patients with fibrosis had worse survival than those with emphysema.

Interpretation: Routine clinical reports of CT lung parenchymal disease identify groups of patients with IPAH and PH-CLD with significantly different prognoses. Isolated CGG changes are not uncommon in IPAH but are not associated with worse survival.'
