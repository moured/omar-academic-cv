abstract: 'Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a useful technique for measuring relationship between two sets of vector data. For paired tensor data sets, we propose a multilinear CCA (MCCA) method. Unlike existing multilinear variations of CCA, MCCA extracts uncorrelated features under two architectures while maximizing paired correlations. Through a pair of tensor-to-vector projections, one architecture enforces zero-correlation within each set while the other enforces zero-correlation between different pairs of the two sets. We take a successive and iterative approach to solve the problem. Experiments on matching faces of different poses show that MCCA outperforms CCA and 2D- CCA, while using much fewer features. In addition, the fusion of two architectures leads to performance improvement, indicating complementary information.'
