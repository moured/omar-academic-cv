abstract: 'Digital watermarking has been proposed for the protection of digital medias. This paper presents two watermarking algorithms for binary images. Both algorithms involve a blurring preprocessing and a biased binarization. After the blurring, the first algorithm embeds a watermark by modifying the DC components of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), followed by a biased binarization, and the second one embeds a watermark by directly biasing the binarization threshold of the blurred image, controlled by a loop. Experimental results show the imperceptibility and robustness aspects of both algorithms.'
