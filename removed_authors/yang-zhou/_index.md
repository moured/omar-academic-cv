Yang was my second PhD student at Hong Kong and he joined in April 2015. His research focused on probabilistic models for tensor analysis and feature extraction. I left Hong Kong in 2016 and continued providing guidance remotely. He joined National University of Singapore after finishing his PhD. See [his homepage](https://yangzhou.netlify.app/) for more information.
