Qiquan was my first ever PhD student, when I started my faculty career at Hong Kong Baptist University. He started in September 2014 and focused on tensor completion for his PhD dissertation. I left Hong Kong in 2016 and continued providing guidance remotely. He joined Huawei after finishing his PhD. See [his LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiquan-shi-hk/) for more information.
