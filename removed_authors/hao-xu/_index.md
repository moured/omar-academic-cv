Hao was an MSc dissertation student working with us on predicting the side effects of taking multiple drugs (poly-pharmacy) using graph neural networks. She was Haiping's second student winning the best dissertation award in the department. She then joined our collaborator's lab in Canada as a Research Assistant until she started her PhD study at the University of California, San Diego in 2022. See [her LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hxu999/) for more information.
