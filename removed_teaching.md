I developed and lead a course on [An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/), part of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)’s [online learning courses in responsible AI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/funding-call-online-learning-courses-responsible-ai).

At the University of Sheffield, I taught two modules below, with teaching materials available on GitHub via links below and [video lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/HaipingLu/playlists). For a full teaching history, see my [CV](https://haipinglu.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
